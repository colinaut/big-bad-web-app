This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#TODO:

* Change fetch so that it uses Epochtime for Public and then when user is logged in it only grabs individual data for events when they are opened (or maybe epoch?) — though I need to make sure it either closes events or grabs ones that are currently open
* add a waiting state for booking button
* figure out why Menu/Pages is failing on capacitor hybrib mobile app on iOS
